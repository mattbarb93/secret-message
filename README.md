## To open the project

Go to https://secret-message-1o0eepd10.now.sh/


## Languages used

This project was done completely in Javascript, with a few small style changes in the HTML file


## Dependencies in the project

For the basic styles, I have used a CSS framework called Materialize (added to the head of the HTML)


## Project Goal

The user will be able to write any message, then after pressing the "Create" button, a new URL will be created and automatically selected (so the user can easily copy and share it with a friend.)
If the new URL is accessed, the message will be displayed, and the person viewing the message will have the ability to also create a shareable message.


## What have I learned?

DOM manipulation when it comes to URLs. The use of window.location to understand the whole path structure, and using logic so it goes from local to production without a problem. Also, a new hosting method to display projects.



## What struggles have I faced?

I've always had problems using DOM manipulation in regards to URL changes. Learning about window.location was great.
